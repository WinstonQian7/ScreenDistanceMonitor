#Eye Distance Monitor for Desktops
#Created by Winston Qian 2021
Ultilizes OpenCV Computer Vision and Ivan Ludvig's eye distance research, explained in detail on his blog (https://ivanludvig.github.io/blog/2019/07/20/calculating-screen-to-face-distance-android
) to measure the distance from a computer screen through a webcam for non-glasses and glasses. Requires focal length and sensor size of the webcam you are currently using. Alternatively, you can use the adjust the distance using my computer button to determine accurate distance measurement. It is recommended to use a ruler from your webcam to your eye level when entering the adjustment factor. If distance isn't detected, make sure you are looking straight at the webcam. 

Project Creation Process:
Overuse of my eyes over quarrentine inspired me to 

Future improvements:
Eye detection for glasses could be improved (use better detection algorithm than haarcascades eyeglasses) 
Package into desktop application
Enable usage on MacOS 


# Face Recognition
Face Recognition refers to identifying a face in a given image and verifying the person in the image. They are used in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to: User Verification, Attendance Systems, Robotics and Augmented Reality. With the growth in applications, we are likely to see great development in the field.

The Face Recognition used in this repository is explained in detail on [byteiota](https://byteiota.com/face-recognition/)
