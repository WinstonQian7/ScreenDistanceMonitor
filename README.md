# Eye Distance Monitor for Desktops
Ultilizes OpenCV Computer Vision and uses [Ivan Ludvig](https://ivanludvig.github.io/blog/2019/07/20/calculating-screen-to-face-distance-android
) research paper to measure the distance from a computer screen. through a webcam for non-glasses and glasses. Requires focal length and sensor size of the webcam you are currently using.
